Sort processes by priority (higher priority first)

FOR each process in sorted list
    IF process has arrived THEN
        Execute process to completion
        Calculate completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time

// Example logic for priority sorting
Function SortProcessesByPriority(processes):
    Sort processes based on:
        1. Higher priority first
        2. If priorities are equal, sort by arrival time
    RETURN sorted list
