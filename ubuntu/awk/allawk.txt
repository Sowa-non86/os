1. Write an awk command to print the lines and line number in the given input file.  
---> awk '{ print NR, $0 }' input_file


2. Write an awk command to print first field and second field only if third field value is 
>=50 in  
the given input file. (Input field separator is “,” and output field separator 
is “,”) 
---> awk -F',' -v OFS=',' '$3 >= 50 { print $1, $2 }' input_file



3. Consider the marks.txt is a file that contains one record per line( comma separate 
fields) of  
the student data in the form of studentid, student name, Telugu marks, 
English marks,  
Maths Marks, Science marks, Social Marks. Write an awk script to 
generate result for  every students in the form of studentid, studentname, Total Marks 
and result. Result is  
PASS if marks is >=30 in TELUGU and English, and if 
marks>=40 in other subjects.  
Result is fail otherwise.  
---> awk -F',' '{
    total = $3 + $4 + $5 + $6 + $7;
    if ($3 >= 30 && $4 >= 30 && $5 >= 40 && $6 >= 40 && $7 >= 40) {
        result = "PASS";
    } else {
        result = "FAIL";
    }
    print $1, $2, total, result;
}' marks.txt



4. Write an awk program to print the fields 1 and 4 of a file that is passed as command 
line  
argument. The file contains lines of information that is separated by “,” as 
delimeter. The awk program must print at the end the average of all 4th field data.  
---> awk -F',' '{
    print $1, $4;
    sum += $4;
    count++;
} 
END { 
    if (count > 0) 
        print "Average of 4th field:", sum / count;
}' input_file



5. Write an awk program to demonstrate user defined functions and system command. 
--->  awk 'function lineLength(line) {
    return length(line);
}
{
    print "Line", NR, "Length:", lineLength($0);
}
END {
    system("echo System command executed");
}' input_file



6. Write an awk script to count the number of lines in a file that do not contain vowels.  
---> awk '{
    if ($0 !~ /[aeiouAEIOU]/) {
        count++;
    }
}
END {
    print "Lines without vowels:", count;
}' input_file



7. Write an awk script to find the number of characters, words and lines in a file.
---> awk '{
    charCount += length($0) + 1; # +1 for newline
    wordCount += NF;
    lineCount++;
}
END {
    print "Characters:", charCount;
    print "Words:", wordCount;
    print "Lines:", lineCount;
}' input_file
